I'm simply managing it for anyone that would like to use this for whatever reason. 

I am guaranteeing almost NO protection from VAC. Use this at your own risk or use a [VAC Bypass](https://github.com/danielkrupinski/VAC-Bypass).

Offsets updated using [Hazedumper](https://github.com/frk1/hazedumper/blob/master/csgo.hpp) and a handful of brain cells.

Feel free to submit pull requests.

Possible updates/optimizations coming soon.
